#  What is NumPy?
# NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

# It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

# NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

# NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

# Why use NumPy?
# NumPy is used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of
# linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
# NumPy is useful for working with large datasets and performing mathematical operations on them.
# NumPy is faster than lists in Python. It is more efficient and uses less memory.
